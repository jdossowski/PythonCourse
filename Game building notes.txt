Notes on game rules:

You have 5 guesses
 - You can trade two of your guesses for hints (the hints will be - is the # odd or even and is the number bigger or less than    54.5 which is the median between 10 and 99)
 - You'll be told when one of the digits in your number matches a digit in the secret number (but won't necessarily know which digit it is.

Notes on code for random number generator:
from random import randint
from math import floor
from math import isnan

secretNum = randint(10,99)

secretNumOnes = secretNum % 10

secretNumTens = floor(secretNum / 10)

#print("The secret number is {0} and the tens place is {1} and the ones place is {2}".format(secretNum, secretNumTens, secretNumOnes))
